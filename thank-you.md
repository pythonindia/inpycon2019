I'm an ML engineer at Scribble Data. When I'm not learning about things I can do with data and Python, I'm reading fantasy fiction novels or thinking of puns to make. I run a book club called [Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore](https://brokebibliophilesbangalore.com) and the local Python chapter - Bangpypers. This was the first time we ran a Pycon India specific meetup at Bangpypers that was very well received and we plan to continue it for next year as well. Cheers!
