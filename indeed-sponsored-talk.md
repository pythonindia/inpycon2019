  * **Venue**: Hall B, Chennai Trade Center
  
  * **Date**: 12th Oct, 2019 - 03:10 PM to 03:40 PM

  * **Abstract**: Push on Green enables teams to automatically update production software systems in a safe and controlled manner. While driving on the roads is being enabled by automation, 58% of the Engineer's time is being spent on manual testing and promoting code to production. The data-driven approach that drives every decision in Indeed has soon made us realize this fact and work towards improving our Operation Efficiency and thus our Engineering Velocity. Push-on-green is one of the key mechanisms that is helping us achieve our goal. Learn the history, approach, and results of the Push-on-green initiative at Indeed during this talk and realize the true meaning and importance of QA.
