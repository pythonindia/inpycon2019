PyLadies Lunch is an event that was introduced in [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/pyladieslunch/) to enable Women attending the conference to learn more about Python or [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/), to meet others in the same boat in a fun, relaxed environment.

Last year at Hyderabad the first PyLadies Lunch was organised at PyCon India. This year following the same idea a PyLadies lunch will be organised in the First day of the Conference.

We cordially invite you to join us and make new friends, forge connections, and share Python programming stories with folks from all around the world and strenghten the Indian PyLadies Community.

- **Who:** Anyone who identifies as a woman who is attending PyCon India
- **When:** Saturday, October 12th, 2019, 1pm - 2pm (during regular conference lunch)
- **RSVP:** At the PyLadies booth in PyCon India
