Lightning Talks are a series of short 5 min talks. Please see the
schedule for Lightning Talk slots. Registration for lightning talks
happen on the day of the conference, just come prepared with a topic
that you would like to share with the rest of the attendees. Since
there will generally be more no. of registrations than the available
slots, there will be a selection process. You will be notified if you
are talk gets selected.
