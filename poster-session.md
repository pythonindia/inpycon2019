Posters are graphical summary of projects or ideas. They are usually
presented with an A0 size poster, but any creative ways are always
welcome. The poster session provides an opportunity to network with
the conference attendees and acts as a starting point for further
discussions. While talks generally needs to appeal to a wide section
of the community, posters can cover niche topics.

PyCon India 2019 will be having a poster presentation session at post
lunch, day 1. During the poster presentation session presenters will
be provided with a poster board that can hold an A0 size poster, and a
table to place their laptop, for demos. Conference attendees
interested in the topic, will stop by, during which a brief
presentation / demo will be provided by the presenter.

The list of selected posters is available from
