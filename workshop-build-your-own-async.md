## Description

In this workshop, you’ll learn about Python’s various async features
by building your own simple async library. Topics include generators,
coroutines, event loops, non-blocking I/O, threads, and more. Note:
the workshop is not about asyncio, but you’ll learn a lot about what
makes it work.

## Prerequisites

  * Attendees should be familiar with functions and classes.

  * Prior experience with network programming and threads will be
    useful.
