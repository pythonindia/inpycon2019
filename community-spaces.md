Local Python user communities and other meetup communities have been
the backbone of PyCon India, since its inception. Keeping this in
mind, this year we are providing space for communities to promote
themselves and to present their work, through community posters.

The poster session will be a 1-hour post lunch session on the first
day of the conference. There are no other parallel tracks scheduled
during that slot. Apart from the regular technical posters we will be
having community posters, as well, as part of the poster session.

If your community would like to take part in this please submit your
proposal at
[https://in.pycon.org/cfp/posters-2019/proposals/](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/posters-2019/proposals/)
Indicate the "Proposal Section" as "Community", while submitting your
proposal.
