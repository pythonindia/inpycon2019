Workshops are an important part of the PyCon India. Hands on learning
is as important as talks for a fulfilling conference experience. Like
talks, workshops are also conducted by the members of the Python
community.

The workshops happen on the third day (14th October). Each workshop is
2.5 hours duration. There are a total of 6 parallel tracks, with two
workshops in each track, one in the morning and one in the
afternoon. You can attend a maximum of two workshops, morning and
afternoon.

## Attending Multiple Workshops

The ticketing platform is designed to allow booking of only one
morning ticket and one afternoon ticket. But if you are booking
tickets in two separate purchases, ensure that you are not booking two
workshops in the same session i.e. two morning or two afternoon.

## Attending Workshops and Devsprints

It might be possible to attend *one* workshop and the devsprints. If
you book two workshops, you will be able to attend the devsprints only
on the second day.
