## The Long Form

PyCon India is a community organized conference intended for advocating the use and adoption of the Python programming language in India. It is also a platform for fostering networking and collaboration among the Python developer community in India.

We value the participation of every member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at PyCon India are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.



### Where
This Code of Conduct applies to the venue of PyCon India 2019 Conference, pre-event & post-event informal gatherings, related online forums and all conference related events, whether officially organized by PyCon India or not.


### Aim
PyCon India 2019 welcomes and is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, neurotype, race, religion, political opinion, culture or employment. We don’t tolerate harassment of attendees in any form.

We believe in the broad spectrum of individual and collective experience and in the inherent dignity of all people. We believe that amazing things happen when people from different worlds and world-views approach each other to create a conversation.

### Be the best you can be
* Be generous, sensitive, understanding and respectful to your fellow Pythonistas, staff and workers. 
* Seek out newcomers and help them feel like they belong. 
* Listen with empathy when someone has a different perspective. 
* Talk to someone if you notice that something could be better. 
* All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience, including people from many different backgrounds. 

### Please refrain from

* Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion
* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Swearing, insults and discriminatory jokes and language.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other event
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material. Sexual language or imagery is inappropriate for all aspects of the conference, including talks
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention or inappropriate physical contact.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.



We have zero tolerance on harassment of conference participants in any form, including, but not limited to the activities mentioned here.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### Code for Speakers

Sexual language or imagery is inappropriate for your talks or slides. Refrain from using sexist, racist or exclusionary language anywhere in your content.

### Code for Exhibitors and Sponsors

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, are subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

### Code for Participants

Be kind and sensitive to the people around you and avoid any kind of offensive behavior. Sexist, racist or any other form of exclusionary or offensive jokes or excessive public swearing are not appropriate at any venue of PyCon India.
