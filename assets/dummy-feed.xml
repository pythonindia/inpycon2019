<p><a href="http://in.pycon.org/">PyCon India</a> is a community run event. What that means is, there is no one person or organization behind the event. People who love the language come together and help in ways they can, to run the event. And here is the opportunity for <em>you</em> to be a part of the community.</p> <p>But before you register to volunteer, there are few things you should be aware of -</p> <ul> <li> <p>Volunteering takes time and effort, sometimes a lot of it. Online activities like handling social networks or handling registrations etc take a lot of time. So if you're volunteering, make sure you can allocate sufficient time.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you're volunteering for offline activities e.g. on spot registration or settings up stages or handling video recording, anything that has to be done on the venue during the event, there is a good chance that you won't be able to attend the sessions. If someone needs you, you have to be there.</p> </li> <li> <p>Volunteering is not a free way into the event. At PyCon India, everybody buys a ticket. Even the event organizers buy tickets. We volunteer because we love Python and PyCon, and want the event to be awesome.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you're still interested in volunteering, here is what you should do next:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Subscribe to <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon">the mailing list</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Register for volunteering in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXp4x5SP73pSRPVYHAzQo7dDdvt_M0JuagMMHxmcBZ4zbDNg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a>. The corresponding workgroup lead will get in touch with you, when he / she needs support.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can pro-actively "Watch" the following repos for activity and track the progress being made. If you can contribute to any of the issues, please feel free to pitch-in.</p> <ul> <li>Workgroups task tracking: https://github.com/pythonindia/inpycon2019-tasks </li> <li>Website: https://github.com/pythonindia/inpycon2019</li> <li>Blog: https://github.com/pythonindia/inpycon-blog</li> <li>CFP software: https://github.com/pythonindia/junction</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Hope this article has served as a starting point for volunteering. If you have any questions, please drop a mail to the mailing list, but make sure to check the <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/inpycon/">mailing list archives</a>, for answers, before posting.</p> <p>Happy volunteering!</p> <p>Credits: Parts of this article were derived from <a href="https://in.pycon.org/blog/2015/volunteering-for-pycon-india-2015.html">the 2015 article, Volunteering for PyCon India</a></p>

<p>The vision of PyCon India 2019 team is to create a <em>responsible</em> and <em>inclusive</em> framework, that brings together Pythonistas from <em>diverse</em> backgrounds and provides them <em>multiple avenues</em> to interact effectively, so that <em>the beauty and the magic</em> of the community can happen.</p> <h2>Responsible</h2> <p>As much as we want to run a great conference, we would also like to take all possible steps to ensure that the impact on the environment is minimized. We will take steps to ensure that food wastage is reduced, single-use <em>anything</em> is avoided, and we will proactively recycle waste generated during the conference.</p> <h2>Inclusive</h2> <p>We would like to ensure that the conference approaches everyone with respect, and that we resolve differences peacfully. In particular, we will proactively extend our invite to women, provide support for students, and ensure that people with disabilities feel welcome at the conference.</p> <h2>Diverse</h2> <p>Python as a language has become an indispensible tool, not just to programmers, but to people from various backgrounds like system administrators, security researchers, test automation engineers, educators, hardware designers, doctors, scientists, mathematicians, accountants, etc. We would like to ensure that the conference reflects the diverse nature of the community itself. We believe that diversity will result in cross-pollination of ideas, knowledge, and experiences, making the conference richer, and the community stronger.</p> <h2>Multiple Avenues</h2> <p>While talks form the core of the conference, we understand people have different ways of expressing themselves. Some would be good at doing a talk, others would prefer showing a demo of their work, there will also be some others who would like to just interact by writing more code. So apart from the talks, the conference will have posters, workshops, dev. sprints, lightning talks, open spaces, and a lot more ways for people to interact, and benefit from the event.</p> <h2>Beauty and Magic of the Community</h2> <p>We all know that during the conference, people get to share their ideas and learn from others. But that benefit is just the tip of an ice-berg. There is lot more to it, people get inspired from other people's work, they make new friends, reconnect with old friends, get their first job, these bonds and relationships open up doors to endless possibilities. After the conference, the world will not be quite the same place, and we are teaming up to make that magic happen!</p>
